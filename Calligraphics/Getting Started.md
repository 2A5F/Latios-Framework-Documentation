# Getting Started with Calligraphics

*Written by Sovogal â€“ Edited by DreamingImLatios*

From damage numbers to simply labeling world space objects, text rendering is
one of those engine features that we don't spend a lot of time thinking about,
but we feel its absence like a missing limb. Like a lot of developers braving
the wilderness of Unity ECS, you were probably surprised to find zero TextMesh
support. That's why I wrote Calligraphics.

## Authoring

Calligraphics provides a single component for authoring text. You can find it in
*Latios* -\> *Calligraphics* -\> *Text Renderer* in the *Add Component Menu*.
For animating the text, an additional component can be found in *Latios* -\>
*Calligraphics* -\> *Text Animation*.

### Text Renderer

The *Text Renderer* component exposes all of the settings required to render
Rich Text to world space.

-   **Text** - The Rich Text to render.
-   **Word Wrap** - Whether to wrap the text should it exceed **Max Line
    Width**.
-   **Max Line Width** - The maximum line width for a single line of text. If
    **Word Wrap** is false, this setting does nothing.
-   **Horizontal Alignment** and **Vertical Alignment** - These two settings
    provide a pivot point for the text rendering. They do not affect text
    alignment, but rather in which directions to expand the text relative to the
    authoring transform.
-   **Color** - The base color of the text when no Color tag is in scope.
-   **Fonts and Materials** - The font-material pairs used by the renderer. When
    the tag is supported, all fonts/materials used within the text will need to
    be specified here.

### Text Animation

This one is a bit of a work in progress. You can specify animation transitions
scoped to specific portions of text. Are there other ways to accomplish this
through shaders? Yep! However, this allows you to animate a single glyph, word,
or line in very basic ways to give a little life to some world space text.

Each transition has the following properties:

-   **Glyph Property** - The property of the glyph to transition. These are
    currently: Opacity, Scale, Color, PositionNoise, RotationNoise, and
    Position.
-   **Animation Style** - Progressive or Simultaneous. This setting exposes
    appropriate properties to render the animation as progressive (iterating
    through each glyph, word, or line in order) or simultaneous (affecting all
    glyphs, words, or lines at once).
-   **Interpolation** - The type of tweening interpolation to use for the
    transition.
-   **Unit Scope** - Whether to scope the animation to Glyph, Word, or Line
-   **Start Index** - The start index of the animation
-   **End Index** - The end index of the animation. This is inclusive, so the
    element at the end index will receive animation as well.
-   **End Behavior** - The behavior at the end of the transition (Revert, Keep
    Final, Loop)
-   **Loop Count** - The number of times to loop the animation if the **End
    Behavior** is set to Loop
-   **Loop Delay** - The delay time between loops if the **End Behavior** is set
    to Loop
-   **Transition Time Offset** - The delay before the transition begins
-   **Transition Duration** - The duration of the transition, once it begins
-   **Progressive Time Offset** - The time offset between each progressive
    animation, if the transition is using a Progressive **Animation Style**

## API

Calligraphics exposes its primary API through a `TextRendererAspect`. The
back-end uses a dynamic buffer of `CalliBytes`, where each element is just a
single byte, to represent a string, but `TextRendererAspect` exposes this buffer
as a `CalliString` to allow you to interact with it similar to the `NativeText`
type.

## Under The Hood

Calligraphics bakes fonts and materials as pairs to a blob asset that contains
Unity TextCore metadata about each font and font-supported glyph (size, vertex
positioning, UVs for the font atlas, glyph-to-glyph positioning specifics, and
so on). At runtime, `GenerateGlyphsSystem` then parses the
`DynamicBuffer<CalliBytes>` and generates the `DynamicBuffer<RenderGlyphs>`. It
also generates the `DynamicBuffer<GlyphMappingElement>` which is used by the
`AnimateTextTransitionSystem`. This system post-processes the glyphs. Finally,
the glyphs are fed raw into a compute shader by the Kinemation rendering
systems.
